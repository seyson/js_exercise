# JavaScript challenge (Album Cataloging App)

Write a JavaScript program that takes the following from the user:
+ Artist (text)
+ Album (text)
+ Year (number)
+ Genre (provide a fixed set of options)

When the user clicks submit, the page displays the album information as an element in an albums list.
None of those fields are allowed to be empty.
Each entry in the albums list contains a button that will remove the entry when the user clicks on it.
